# ðŸ’§ Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts multiple water pollutants using **supervised machine learning**, specifically `RandomForestRegressor` wrapped with `MultiOutputRegressor`. It was developed during a **1-month AICTE Virtual Internship sponsored by Shell** in **June 2025** under mentorship.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Objective

The goal is to create a predictive system that estimates key **water quality parameters** based on **year and station location ID**, helping environmental agencies monitor pollution levels early and take timely action.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

In this project, we:

- **Collected** real-world water quality data from a public CSV (hosted on GitHub)
- **Cleaned and preprocessed** the data by handling missing values and converting date to extract useful features (year and station ID)
- **Selected** only `year` and `station ID` as input features, which are simple yet meaningful for prediction
- **Trained a multi-output regression model** using `MultiOutputRegressor` with `RandomForestRegressor` to predict six pollutant levels
- **Evaluated** the model using **RÂ² Score** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for each target pollutant
- **Saved** the trained model and structure using `joblib`
- **Deployed** a user-friendly **Streamlit web app** to take inputs (year and station ID) and display predicted pollutant levels
- **Visualized** average pollutant levels and trends using charts and plots inside the app

## ðŸ“Š Predicted Water Pollutants

The model predicts concentrations of the following six key pollutants:

- **Oâ‚‚ (Dissolved Oxygen)**
- **NOâ‚ƒ (Nitrate)**
- **NOâ‚‚ (Nitrite)**
- **SOâ‚„ (Sulfate)**
- **POâ‚„ (Phosphate)**
- **CL (Chloride)**
